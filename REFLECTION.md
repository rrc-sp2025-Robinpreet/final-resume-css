# What my code does?

I tried to make my code to work in css styles and make it more professional and easy to read.

- Make the code more accessible by adding the grids and borders.
- Linked the code with html for great output.
- Contrast with  google pallete colors and adjusted the font size for the different medias.


# What was my coding process?

- I made changes in  the html code and added the link of css file.
- In the css file i added the colors and font styles  which will help my resume to make it clear.
- Add of margins and padding made my code more concise and clear.


# What changes I have?
 
- I made changes like when the i click on my links it will change the colors.
- The heading of my name firstly was on side but i align it in the centre.
- Added the borders for different sections. 
- centred my profile picture under my name.


# What challenges did i have?

- I faced difficulty to adjust my resume borders and alignment for the other medias as well like mobile phones or desktop screen.

- color choices which will  be liked by all type of age groups so, I went with neutral shades like greyish and white. 

# What would i do differently now?

i like the hovering and navigation and i tried this in my css style file.I also tried some colors which was given in my assignment for  preferences like flexbox so I want to know about this more.
